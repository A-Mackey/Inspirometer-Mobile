# Inspirometer-Mobile
A mobile app that will help monitor and track the lung capacity of the user.

# How to use
## Needed
> Visual Studio Code (Or some other code editor)

> Node JS

> Expo (mobile app)

## Instructions
Clone or download this repository (I reccomend to clone as updates will regularly be pushed).
Use a code editor and open the folder.
Run ```npm install``` within the directory inside of the terminal.
This should install the needed packages.

Next, run ```expo start``` in the terminal (make sure you are in the correct directory) and
a web browser should be launched with a QR code displayed. Use your mobile app with Expo installed on it,
and scan the QR code with your camera. This should launch the Expo app and start building the project.
Wait for it to finish building and the app should be running.
